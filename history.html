          class="restaurant_name">មរតក</span></h2>

      <p>
        មរតក, meaning "heritage" in Khmer, is a tribute to the soul of Cambodia. Our vision is to preserve and honor
        Khmer culinary traditions while inviting the world to experience the warmth, depth, and artistry of Cambodian
        cuisine.
      </p>

      <h3 class="sub_title"><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> A Culinary Heritage</h3>
      <p>
        Each dish we serve is crafted from recipes that have stood the test of time. From the royal flavors once served
        in the palaces of the Khmer Empire to humble countryside meals rich in soul and simplicity, our food tells the
        story of a nation.
        <br><br>
        Ingredients are locally sourced and prepared with deep respect for tradition — think fragrant lemongrass, creamy
        coconut, fermented pastes, and hand-ground spices. Nothing is rushed. Every element is intentional.
      </p>

      <h3 class="sub_title"><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> Ambience with Meaning</h3>
      <p>
        Our restaurant is designed to reflect Cambodia’s timeless charm. Traditional wooden architecture, hand-carved
        decor, and soft traditional music create an atmosphere that invites reflection and appreciation. You don’t just
        eat here — you journey through Khmer history with your senses.
      </p>

      <h3 class="sub_title"><i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> Our Master Chefs</h3>
      <p>
        The culinary team at មរតក includes master chefs with decades of experience. Trained in traditional techniques
        and modern presentation, they create meals that honor the past and satisfy today's palate.
        <br><br>
        Our chefs don’t just cook — they tell stories through every dish.
      </p>
